# Software-Design-Document
CS 230 project

The Gaming Room was the client for this project. They wanted to create a web-based game application for multiple users to access at once. 

I was able to research the best Operating System features for this project. This was the most detailed part of my project. 

Having the template there to guide me through the designing and coding was very helpful. 

I would revise the recommendations part of the design. I didn't completely understand what this part of the document was asking for. I would reach out to sources to better understand and 
re-work this part of the project.

I was very concerned with the aspect of ensuring the software would be easy for the user to navigate. It's important to consider what the user's needs are because that's the purpose of 
the designing. To meet the user's needs.

I did a lot of research on different OS to see what the best approach to designing the software would be. Next time I would like to reach out to outside sources that have experience with these type of projects
rather than researching completely on my own.
